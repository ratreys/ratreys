# Hi, I'm Rey — a frustrated web developer.

Currently learning how to build websites with an emphasis on ACCESSIBILITY, READABILITY, and SPEED.

## What else?
* Once a teacher (senior high school).
* I love (😍) typography.
* Obsessed with the idea of self-mastery.
* Own — and earn — a WordPress site hosted at [Closte](https://closte.com/) and is using [Blocksy](https://creativethemes.com/blocksy/) theme.
